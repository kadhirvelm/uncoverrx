# CohortRx

## Summary

This product helps scientists find cohorts of related drugs by leveraging the power of large language models. It relies on the ability of LLMs to traverse large, complex, and unstructured data, in this case specifically for exploring molecules.

It integrates many data sources together in order to provide a unified solution for drug hunters to find molecules of interest.
